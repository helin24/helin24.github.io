        	<p>
        		Pairing was definitely helpful; everything feels slightly easier when there are two people working on something rather than one. I think I generally enjoy talking to people for technical work, because extracting and explaining how I understand something really solidifies concepts for me and I like the feeling of solving a problem with another person. Coding remotely is slightly a challenge, but no major issues. I didn't realize how much trouble I have with the terminology - often I found myself thinking about a specific line of code we should use but would be unable to find the exact phrase, resulting in me saying stuff like "that thing that aligns text."
