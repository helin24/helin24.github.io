		<h3>Forces of Assortment</h3>
		<h4>07/01/14</h4>
		
		<p>
			Technology has become a powerful tool for bringing people together, but togetherness and apartness are two sides of the same coin. By making it easier for people with similar interests or attitudes to connect, technology can also lower the frequency that people will interact with those who are dissimilar. This has broad implications for how we see others and our empathy for everyone in our society.
		</p>
		<p>
			Targeted advertising is one of the most notoriously discussed issues related to technology and assortment. The notoriety is partly due to privacy concerns and a consideration of what counts as unethical capitalistic manipulation. A part is also related to assortment, and the question of whether we can really be organized and targeted to buy certain products because we fall into a particular market segment. Are we so simple as to be this easily segregated, or are we eventually molded to fit segments due to the messages we see or do not see? This is an example of business-to-consumer interaction rather than person-to-person interaction, but the products we buy do much to shape our existence and attitudes. More importantly, when targeted advertising appears on topics like political issues, educational opportunities, or cultural media, social divisions are magnified and perpetuated over time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Already our physical society appears to be sorting by wealth, race, urbanization, or many other factors. Perhaps it is natural that our online society sorts similarly. We're obviously more likely to have online connections to people that were geographically, professionally, culturally close to at some point in our lives. If we're city dwellers, we probably are more interested in news related to public transportation or urban real estate compared to the population in suburban and rural areas.
		</p>
		<p>
			But while it's often hard for people to move between physical society boundaries, it's much easier online to skip around and sample thoughts from many sources, as long as we're not channeled into specific routes. Currently technology seems to be more interested in separating people and feeding us more of what we think we like rather than encouraging us to be well-rounded citizens sharing common concerns. However, it would technically easy (thought perhaps economically or culturally difficult) to reverse this trend.
		</p>
		<p>
			The widespread use of recommendation algorithsm to provide tailored content to individuals often has the impact of boxing people into specific viewpoints and limiting the scope of social concerns we perceive. What if, instead, facebook showed us messages like "people who read this article were unlikely to read this one?" Or what if Pandora suggested listening to a bit of grunge if we've been listening to Maurice Ravel the last few days?
		</p>
<!-- 		<p>
			Technology has the power of letting us find the comfort of people who are similar to us, when previously people with niche interests had a harder time finding a group. Technology has equal power of ensuring that we continue to cross paths with people who are different too.
		</p>
 -->		
 		<p>
 			It's my hope that the tech world will pivot towards encouraging people to sometimes assort by dissimilarity, despite the ease and comfort of being with those we already understand.
