	<h2>About Me</h2><br>
	<p>
		I wonder about myself all the time - I suppose many people do (wonder about themselves, that is). I came to this page and DevBootcamp through the demands of curiosity. I've always enjoyed my brief experiences programming but never learned about it with much depth or practicality, and this seemed like a good opportunity to embrace both. 
	</p>
	<p>	
		Outside of this, I dabble in music, figure skating, finance, drawing, photography, and whatever else I can remember. I mostly grew up in York, PA and went to college in Philadelphia. Then I spent three years in New York City, which I found overall pleasant but economically inefficient for me. I moved to Chicago in July 2014, and so far I've been enjoying the tasty regular food and the city's bikeability. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I like dogs and frogs (I eat neither), meeting strangers, and wordplay, and my name is pronounced like "Helene."
