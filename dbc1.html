<p class="narrative">Today I realized that I've overscheduled umemployment, which explains why I'm working on this now. I began this morning with pseudo-meditation (which I guess is actual meditation) and then went <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_skating"><b>ice skating</b></a> (I <i>love</i> ice skating!!). I read over DBC materials for a few hours around lunch, then left for my next engagement.</p>
<p class="narrative">In the afternoon I volunteered at a <a href="http://www.nypl.org/locations/countee-cullen" target="_blank">public library</a>, where I was tasked with face painting children for the library's summer program. I painted tiger stripes, spider webs, eyeshadow, flowers, hearts, and butterflies. Then I returned home and have been working on Week 1 materials since!</p>
