			Did you know that ice dancing used to be a popular social activity? (Well, I guess ballroom dancing used to be a popular social activity too.) I was surprised to learn this, since figure skating is only on the minds of the general public every four years for the Olympics, and considered to be a fun activity just for pre-pubescent girls.<br>
			On the contrary, ice skating can be great exercise for everyone, and the basic skills are more accessible than most people think. Sustaining balance requires strong core muscles, stroking and crossovers require strong quads, and the arms are engaged in just about every move. Move on to jumps or step sequences, and exercises become more cardiovascular.

			People feel resistance to figure skating as an activity because it seems capital-intensive. But really, there's very little needed - just a pair of skates and a rink nearby. I think many people are turned off by rental skates, since they're generally uncomfortable and not conducive to learning. Really quite silly since basic, basic skates can be purchased for less than $100. Comparable to a tennis racquet or a month's gym membership in NYC<br>

	<div class="aside"><b>About me<b><br>
		I started learning to ice skate in December 2013, and it soon became my primary hobby. While I've always been an active person (going to the gym, training for a half marathon, playing tennis, etc.), I wouldn't consider myself <i>good</i> at any of these activities - my motivation for participating was primarily for my health.<br>
		My motivation for figure skating, however, is completely encased in the activity itself, and thus it's provided a focus for all of my physical activities. Now, all of my exercise is to improve my figure skating - running and interval training is for jumping and general endurance, yoga is good for balance (spinning!) and flexibility <br>
		I'm really just a beginner, but I've found this activity to be such a wonderful full-body workout that I suspect it could be marketed to a much wider audience.
