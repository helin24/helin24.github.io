		<h3>JavaScript's Prospects</h3>
		<h4>06/22/14</h4>
		

			<p>
			From what I can tell, JavaScript is popular in web development because it is popular in web development. Due to its early availability as a client-side scripting language for web pages, JavaScript gained momentum in the form of browser support, and thus more programmers had to use JavaScript. Now, JavaScript has support across web browsers, meaning things that are written in JavaScript are available to almost all devices, while programs for many other languages require separate environments. </p>

			<p>
			The popularity of JavaScript has also contributed to improvements in its ease of use. "Libraries" are databases of pre-written code, and JavaScript has many (e.g. JQuery one of the most used) - these can be used to make writing programs more efficient or increasing compatibility with other programming languages. Many programmers recount using JavaScript in the early days as a painful experience due to unwieldy code and browser incompatibilities, but libraries have largely alleviated these problems. JavaScript has evolved from providing basic ornamentation for graphics to executing much more complex tasks, especially due to developments like AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML, which allows systems to update without page refreshes). </p>

			<p>
			Moving away from the network effects that benefit JavaScript, what about the inherent traits of the language? JavaScript has been controversial because it is seen as a pragmatic language, and one which is a mix of C and Lisp (C is imperative and Lisp is functional). Programming paradigms can be a fairly sophisticated issue, but basically imperative languages employ a command structure to change the program state, while functional languages evaluate expressions with inputs. JavaScript is multi-paradigm, and described as a mix of functional, imperative, and object-oriented styles. I believe this "pragmatism" essentially means that JavaScript is capable of doing more things because of its mixed nature - this makes it more flexible than other languages that may be more purely situated in any one programming paradigm. JavaScript is also frequently described as "powerful," which is a vague term but suggests the language is able to do more with fewer lines of code or less "resources" from the computer. Specific good things about JavaScript that are often discussed are the object literal notation, the ability to use functions as parameters, and node.js, which is a server-side language (back end rather than client-side, which is front end web page) that is asynchronous, meaning that things do not need to be processed in order. </p>

			<p>
			On the other hand, JavaScript's mixed identity is also seen as a big problem - much of the internet seems to despise JavaScript. Some of this is due to frustrations with the language's association with the DOM (document object model) and incompatibilities that linger in trying to make JavaScript run consistently across browsers. The "compromise" between C and Lisp also appears to irritate programmers, because some details are seen as illogical and confusing, especially to users who are past beginners but not quite experts in the language. Global variables are also seen as unwieldy and confusing, especially as the language is often used to nest functions within functions, making tracking variables more difficult. </p>

			<p>
			Essentially, it seems JavaScript is sticky and unlikely to wither suddently. Browsers are ubiquitous and changes appear slow, so it seems unlikely that another language would displace JavaScript without wide-ranging support. Even though there are many complaints about JavaScript, any other language providing for flexible and varied use across many applications would likely elicit similar frustrations. </p>
