		<h3>Classes to See Clearly</h3>
		<h4>07/06/14</h4>
		
		<p>
			Much of programming is an attempt to reduce redundancy while increasing order, and classes are another example. When certain statements are executed many times, we can bundle them into methods to easily repeat the sequence; analogously, when certain methods are called many times for objects that are similar to each other, we can group these objects into one class and let them all have access to a set of methods.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using data structures and classes to model real-world "things" can be an efficient way to organize our perception of what these things do. Classing real-world things pushes us to consider what things can be categorized together and what common traits they should possess, while modeling processes can be more helpful for understanding an object than reading about it or describing its capabilities. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Investment Class Example</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			I'll run through a simplistic example from finance/business strategy - considering investments and whether they are worthwhile. Generally an investment requires a cash outflow initially, but will provide cash inflows in future periods. We could simply add up all of the values, but this would ignore our general preference for earning money sooner rather than later. If we are indifferent between receiving $100 today or $105 next year, then we could say that our required rate is 5%, and the "present value" of any future money we receive is the amount of money divided by 1.05. A <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow">discounted cash flow (DCF)</a> calculation is where we consider the timing of estimated cash flows and discount future cash flows by our required rate to arrive at a single number that represents the value of all of the cash flows today. After calculating the DCF, a business can make a decision on whether to proceed with a project.
		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			The class "Investment" includes three instance methods, i.e. things that are done with any instance of the class: we can come up with a new investment concept (initialize method), we can decide whether or not to make the investment (proceed? method), and we can calculate the value of the investment (dcf method). None of these are class methods because it would be difficult to decide to proceed with the class of all possible investments - the decision is based on each individual investment's characteristics. 
		</p>
			<!-- Example of class methods possible? -->
		<p>
			Let's look at each instance method in more detail.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Initialize:</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			This method requires one argument - an array of cash flows expected from the investment. The method sets practical limits on what argument can be given to create a new investment, which matches real-world conditions. If an empty array is passed in, this represents an absence of cash flows in or out, which would not present any investment decision. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that the @ symbol indicates an instance variable - the @cashFlows variable will be accessible by all methods that may be called on an instance of Investment, but they will not be accessible by the entire class of investments. @cashFlows will become an array that represents the sequence of cash flows from the investment, something that is unique to each investment. On the other hand, @@rate is a class variable which will be assigned to every new Investment instance, because a business will always have the same preference on required rate regardless of what investment they choose to make.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>DCF:</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			The #dcf method calculates the discounted cash flow of an investment, translating the array of cash flows into an integer value - in theory, the business should be indifferent between the integer value as an immediate payoff and the cash flows in the array spread out over time. Note that this method uses both the instance variable @cashFlows and the class variable @@rate. In addition, this method uses a local variable value, which is not accessible in other instance methods. Instead, it is created and returned within the confines of the #dcf method.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Proceed?:</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			The #proceed? method calls another instance method, #dcf, and decides whether to make the investment based on whether it seems to be a net benefit to the business.
		</p>
		<p>
			So how does this turn out?
		</p>
		<p>
			We create an object "machine" that can be bought for $100, but will generate income of $25 in the first year, $25 in the second year, etc. With this investment, we can then call the #dcf method to see how much it is worth in terms of today's money, and the answer is -$19. This means that logically, the business should reject this investment. A thorny decision, but made easier when modeled as a class!
