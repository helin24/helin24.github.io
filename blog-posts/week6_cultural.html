		<h3>Specificity > Stereotype Threats</h3>
		<h4>07/13/14</h4>
		
		<p>
			Stereotype threat is the phenomenon where a minority group is associated with poor performance in a certain field, and this negative association actually leads to poor performance. Stereotype threat has been frequently discussed in the context of worse standardized test results for Black and Hispanic students and worse performance in math for women. However, studies suggest that stereotype threat can be generally described as a situation where an individual is informed that people similar to them tend to be better or worse than average at a specific activity, and this leads the individual's performance to be better or worse than it would have been without the stereotype-related information.
		</p>
 		<p>
 			<h4>What is Growing Up?</h4>
 			Our growth as individuals often mirror our growth as civilizations. Over the course of millennia, humanity has worked to parse causes and consequences of various events in our lives, and we are increasingly informed of what we control and what we don't. We no longer expect our rain dances to cause rain, but we now understand how chemicals can prevent pests and we can create crop varieties that produce their own pest-preventing chemicals. 
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			Similarly, as children, we tend to have a poor understanding of what affects our performance. We may believe in the power of a rabbit's foot or we might stash a history book under our pillow the night before a test. As we grow older, we hopefully become more enlightened and realize that we perform better on tests when we study, or that we can run longer distances if we run every day. In the context of stereotype threat, the hopeful interpretation is that as we learn more about human abilities, we arrive at truer understandings of what impacts our performance and what is in our control, leading us to be less affected by negative generalizations related to unchageable aspects of our identity.
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			However, this is easier said than done. Many adults still believe they're inherently "bad at math" or could never learn to play a musical instrument (two common examples of "I could never X"). This isn't exactly stereotype threat, but it is similar in that it's allowing a generalization to affect individual performance in a specific situation. Why are many people susceptible to this? I think it's just that most people require repeated external affirmations to correct their inaccurate beliefs about their abilities, and that not enough people receive enough external affirmations throughout their lives to overcome negative beliefs or begin seeking their own affirmations to overcome negative beliefs.
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			<h4>My Experience</h4>
 			I've been very fortunate in this regard because I haven't suffered much from stereotype threats or negative belief systems when it came to my academic abilities. For this I mostly credit my parents, who regularly taught me math and science at an early age. They showed me with many lessons and mock quizzes that with practice/study, learning new concepts and taking tests can be relatively easy. I'm often amused by the assiduous logistical preparation people put into test taking - checking and re-checking pencils and calculator batteries, getting precisely the right seat, etc. - and the last-minute studying for material you've been preparing for six months. To me, these are rituals akin to rain dancing - I believe if you put in the work where it matters (generally studying in a sustainable, efficient way ahead of time), you can show up late, forget your pencil, and still take exams relatively stress-free; these logistical details matter very little compared to the hours of studying the underlying content. 
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			On the other hand, I had to overcome some negative belief systems on my own when it came to some physical tasks. This is related to stereotype threat - I was a small, underweight person growing up, and generally believed that people my size aren't athletic. Even five years ago, I had all sorts of paranoias about running - whenever I went running, I had to make sure that I had eaten something light but substantial enough for lunch, I would have access to water throughout my run, I had a phone in case I collapsed on the street, and I had a set running path to match an exact distance. After practicing distance running for a summer, these paranoias dissipated with repeated affirmations that I would make it back home eventually. I don't do distance running regularly these days, but in the instances I do, my checklist now consists of just keys (which admittedly, I've occasionally forgotten).
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			<h4>Systemic Misinformation</h4>
 			I'm aware that my examples come from a place of privilege - my negative beliefs have generally originated from my own insecurities, while those around me have usually encouraged and supported me. Many people do not have this luxury and struggle because they are told by others through words and actions that their abilities are limited. It doesn't help that journalists seize on studies reporting innate differences arising from gender, race, or other genetic categorizers. 
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			But even allowing that we have different levels of innate talent as individuals or as demographic groups, we should consider whether our innate talent manifests as a floor or a ceiling, and to what extent innate talent affects the speed at which we learn things. For example, does having less "talent" for math mean that we have to spend more time learning the basics, or that we will never be able to understand anything more complex than long division? Does it mean we need double the time to learn a new concept as someone else, or just 5% more time? 
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			Obviously this varies for the specific skill in question, but overall, people overestimate the impact of innate ability and underestimate the broadness of their potential ability. Many people don't realize that once they start mastering the basics of a discpline, they no longer feel that their capabilities are limited by a clear ceiling and they can learn new information at an increasing rate. 
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			From my background (engineering in college, then worked in finance), it's common that people remark "Oh, your job/education sounds so impressive; I could never do that!" as a compliment. Many people in these situations will politely reply "Well, maybe, but I could never do X!" But we should avoid these statements at all costs - they reflect the attitude that we can only do what we've been doing already or what people like us (whatever category that may be) should be doing. A more accurate response is usually "It takes some time to get started, but I'm sure you could learn." 
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			<h4>A Quasi-Statistical Summary</h4>
 			When confronted with issues related to how groups differ from each other, I often think about the concept of an ANOVA test, which compares the variance between groups to the variance within groups. Media generally focuses on the former (e.g. the average test scores of men vs. the average scores of women) while ignoring the latter (e.g. the variance among individual men or the variance among individual women). In the same way, our insecurities often cause us to focus on generalizations of our "abilities" (e.g. "I'm good at chemistry but bad at physics") rather than specific factors which cause our measured abilities to differ in different situations (e.g. having spent more time studying certain subjects). More specificity ==> less stereotype threat.
