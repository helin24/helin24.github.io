		<h3>More Thinking Style Nonsense?</h3>
		<h4>06/19/14</h4>
		

		<p>
			Now I love self-analysis and introspection and I also love that this is a big part of DevBootcamp's program. But I really think this test is ridiculous and devoid of meaning, especially since there was no output listing famous people sharing my learning style. </p>

			<p> I don't find the learning styles unhelpful, exactly - I think these are legitimately different ways of learning material. However, I do not believe people are really innately different in how they process information; I expect that contextual variance (i.e. what type of information we're learning) is much more improtant than personality variance (i.e. the individual doing the learning). Thus, I believe any behavioral difference exhibited (which, notably, this quiz does not really consider - this quiz is a vocabulary interpretation test at best) most likely reflect what subjects we've spent the most time learning in our lifetimes </p>

			<p>What do I think of my thinking style and how it will affect my experience? I don't think I have an innate thinking style. My results are below, but I don't think they mean anything. I think my experience will be negatively affected by eye-rolling and feet-dragging if I have to further contemplate my personal thinking style and how it will affect my experience. </p>

			This was the result of my thinking styles test:

			<p> On the more positive side, I should clarify again that I don't have anything against thinking about thinking styles, and I suspect the idea that none of these are truly reflective of who we are as people is more aligned with DBC's approach. Ideally, we should train ourselves to move around these thinking styles by taking on different activities and challenges, and not allowing ourselves to believe that our mindset is in any way fixed. I think it's quite clear in programming (and in life) that there will be times to be more risk-taking and experimental, and other times to be more orderly and thoughtful. </p>

			<p> Perhaps at the end of DBC, it would be more interesting to have our peers rate us in this paradigm and see whether there is agreement. This would at least deconstruct the behavior to interpreation barrier of this test. I would be fascinated to be outed as a vehement abstract sequential thinker by others. </p>
