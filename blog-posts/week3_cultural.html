		<h3>More Thinking Style Nonsense?</h3>

			Now I love self-analysis and introspection and I also love that this is a big part of DevBootcamp's program. But I fail to understand why DBC is so obsessed with this ridiculous Gregorc test. The page does not even provide a list of famous people that share your learning style! 

			This was the result of my thinking styles test:

			I find these results to be silly and difficult to apply to actual learning in the manner suggested. I do not believe people are really that different in how they process information; I expect that contextual variance (i.e. what type of information we're learning) is much more improtant than personality variance (i.e. the individual doing the learning). 

			For example, when I chose descriptive words in the survey, the Gregorc thinking style suggests that my style is least similar to concrete random. In my research I came across this mapping of academic fields that correlate with scores:

			Funny enough, I received two bachelor's degrees - one in bioengineering, and the other in business. Did I struggle with "experimenting to find answers" or "solving problems independently?" Hardly. 

			Learning style purports to address how you prefer to learn, whether it is in quiet vs. noisy environment, cooperating with others vs. independently, etc. 

			How can we get a pure analysis of our preferred learning styles? This assumes that our preferred style does not vary depending on what we do, or that test takers of different styles have been doing about the same things as other test takers.

			Are these learning styles fixed? No. I feel like it could be destructive to make everyone recognize a learning style to begin with. Learning styles are legitimate, but attributing a main learning style to a person is detrimental.
