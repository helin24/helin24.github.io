		<h3>Conflict</h3>
		<h4>07/27/14</h4>
		
		<p>
			I've always enjoyed living with large groups of people because I find there are fewer conflicts when many parties are present to balance out personalities and negotiate reasonable solutions. However, my residential life has not been devoid of conflict.
		</p>
		<p>
			A couple of years ago, I was living in a townhouse of five people in Manhattan. We all found the place through craigslist, so none of us knew each other prior to living together. I managed a spreadsheet that summarized payments for shared services (e.g. utilities, cable, cleaning supplies) and calculated appropriate rent divisions among the residents, so I ended up making decisions about purchases and how much people owed in special circumstances (e.g. moving out, partial month stays).
		</p>
		<p>
			At one point, controversy brewed starting with the subject of cleaning. We previously hired a cleaning person once a week, but one of the roommates (anonymized as Anna) was unsatisfied with this arrangement and suggested that we split up cleaning chores among ourselves to save money. This worked fine for a period, but soon we tired of cleaning and the cleanliness of our apartment slipped. Anna, who was less tolerant of grime, soon found herself prodding other roommates to fulfill their cleaning duties, and some of the other roommates grew resentful and stubborn. I certainly didn't appreciate being asked to clean when (a) I felt fine about the state of the apartment and (b) I wasn't enthusiastic about discontinuing the cleaning service. Eventually, Anna made plans to move out, but not before she alienated one of the other roommates (who had become a friend of mine, anonymized as Beca) and started refusing to pay for her portion of shared items. This was a huge headache for me, as the manager of a rent allocation spreadsheet that was growing rapidly in complexity, and as Beca was frequently seeking my advice as she felt bullied and nagged by Anna. After a number of tense emails between Anna and me negotiating rent, we finally had an in-person conversation to discuss how we were going to resolve our rent numbers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ultimately, this conversation was helpful and I'm glad we approached the conflict this way. Anna revealed that she felt underappreciated in the apartment, because she consistently did her portion of cleaning and buying shared items. She also felt that I gave too much weight to Beca's concerns because of our friendship and that I gave Beca too much "life support" (she was struggling with her finances and graduate school papers at that time). I think both were fair assessments, and we both realized through the conversation that the numbers we were calculating for rent were minimally important compared to how we felt we were treated at the apartment. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This conflict could have been avoided or minimized if I had suggested reinstating a cleaning person earlier on instead of avoiding the problem and avoiding cleaning. It's also important to keep aware of how everyone is feeling on a regular basis - even though we all lived together, it was rare that we would see each other long enough to have conversations, with our jobs, hobbies, errands, significant others, etc.
