		<h3>A Catalogue of Values</h3>
		<h4>07/20/14</h4>
		
		<p>
			I've always felt most happy in periods where I've become competent at much of my work and in my community, and I therefore feel excited at the prospect of moving on to other ideas and challenges in the near future. This has fortunately happened for me at many transition periods in my life - at the ends of high school and college, and just recently as I prepared to leave my first "real job."
		</p>
		<p>
			If I break up this feeling into value words, I could group them into a few thematic bunches. 
				<li> <b> accomplishment, competence, confidence, credibility, and effectiveness </b>- a sense that I am managing my work and flourishing in it, that I have developed some sort of expertise and my usual work has become a pleasant, reliable challenge rather than a daily struggle. 
				<li> <b> community, helping others and society, leadership, meaningfulness, and openness </b>- a feeling of belonging somewhere and accomplishing things that will help the rest of the world, even if minorly.
				<li> <b>activism, adventure, challenge, courage, creativity, faith, growth, and vibrancy </b>- knowing that I am striving for something larger and improving myself. 
				<li><b> insight, introspection, knowledge, nature, and spirituality </b>- taking time to ponder and learn meaningful things about life.
		</p>
		<p>
			Competence is a good value to discuss further, since it sounds simple but reflects a rather complex balance. My first thought of competence is as something that is black and white or pass/fail - can you do a task or can't you? However, a meaningful sense of competence arises with tasks that are not robotic, even though they fall into one category. In my last job, I spent much of my time giving an overview of the oil and gas industry to clients. However, competence requires first defining what constitutes a well-completed task (e.g. clients can generally ask significantly improved questions after the overview), then understanding all of the steps required to complete it, and then adding or removing steps so that more value is created for the same amount of time or effort expended. I feel like one can be considered "competent" at a task once they have defined a task and found a reusable process; however, a person is not truly competent unless they continue to refine and re-evaluate their process. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I try to live up to all of the values I mentioned, but I know that I can be lazy and distracted. I feel like it hinges on whether I am trying to do my work well - adherence to my other values flows from how I'm managing on the first group of values. Thinking about my list of values reminds me that I have been able to achieve a great deal in my life and that I'm capable of doing much more. I don't feel like problems I'll face at DBC will be predominantly a result of stereotype threat, but reminding myself of my values should be helpful to encourage myself to delve deeply into my questions and avoid putting off work or talking to other people.
