		<h3>DBC's Learning Approach</h3>
		<h4>06/11/14</h4>
		

		<p>Objectives: Consider DBC's culture and learning approach, and predict how you will react to this approach.</p>

		<p> I would summarize Shereef's fireside chat as discussing a culture of experimentation and construction. He emphasizes tbe newness of the DBC program structure, which relates to a sense of adventure shared among both students and staff. </p>
		<p>I think this approach should work for me. I always work better and learn more when I feel needed, so I like the emphasis that students contribute to the effectiveness of the program as a whole (through feedback to each other, suggestions to staff, etc.).  </p>
		<p>I also like that the culture is open to change - this seems to reflect an ability to take reasonable risks and a dedicated interest in providing the right support system to take risks. I think for much of my life, I've spent more time with people who have an adequate support system but remain unwilling to take risks. </p>		
		<p>Perhaps most importantly, the human component of DBC's culture appeals to me and was the main reason that pushed me to take this opportunity. Empathy is something that I consider often (how I can be more empathetic and how I can help others be more empathetic), so I'm looking forward to meeting and learning from people who share these values.</p>

		<p>I am nervous to experience what the time commitment will feel like. I've always had many activities that I like to spend time on regularly, so I'll likely feel a little sad and burned out if I don't have time to do other things. Shereef's answer to the question addressing DBC's hours alleviated this nervousness somewhat, but it will be hard to judge until I get there.</p>
