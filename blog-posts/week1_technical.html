Quora

I'm drawn to Quora primarily for its content - I like that the site is heavy on information and explanation and especially supportive of long-form answers.

The format of the site is also likeable. The white and grey color scheme is simple and not distracting. The clean layout still allows information to be segmented and skimmable, while generally maintaining an unassuming air.  

The format and content of Quora are well matched, in my opinion. Undistracting format allows for greater focus on information, and clarity in design encourages clarity in answers as well. The eveness of content sizing matches the democratic nature of the forum - there's nothing that's promoted with larger text and instead, upvoted answers just have notes to the side.

Quora's search bar is prominent and clear, so navigating to specific topics is simple. The site also condenses major areas of interest into just six lines on the left, so that the space doesn't look cluttered. My main complaint about quora is that it can be hard to browse through random questions and topics - generally navigation feels channeled through topics you already follow, people you already follow, etc.


aeon magazine

I've only visited aeon magazine a few times (linked through feedly, usually), but I did remember it as a striking web site. aeon publishes longform news and editorial content, often around social issues or a cross-section of psychology, science, and culture.

The main page of the web site features scrolling images related to the magazine's current cover stories. In general, the site feels very modern - it's colorful and dynamic, with neat, square demarcations. 

I feel like this is slightly at odds with the content of the site, which tends to be in-depth, long, and thoughtful. However, the topics covered are also somewhat eccentric much of the time, and some of it could be bordering on populist science. So in the latter sense, the colorful text and image-heavy visuals may be reasonable. Also, aeon is trying to encourage people to see longform journalism as more interesting than is currently assumed, so this probably makes sense.

Ease of use is high, as generally one would visit this page to browse news. The search button is somewhat small, but sufficient and workable.

nytimes.com

The New York Times is still a journalistic standard, so I often read their articles for news and cover stories, along with comments from other readers. 

Although I consume a lot of content on this site, I wouldn't say that the web site is particularly pleasing visually or easily navigable. There are many boxes of varying sizes on the home page (perhaps unavoidable), and articles quickly move down the display hierarchy as time passes. Often someone will ask me "have you read ___ article?" and to find it, googling is significantly easier than searching through the web site's menus.

Though the nytimes homepage is clunky, the formatting of news articles is beautiful and elegant. I especially like that comments slide out from the right, and are categorized into nytimes picks, readers' picks, and all comments - this really helps because it prevents reading comments from feeling drained or like one is wading through the filth of humanity.

Ultimately, the nytimes sells subscriptions and I never got around to purchasing one - I guess I never read it enough to feel like a monthly subscription would be warranted.
