		<h3>Arrays vs. Hashes - A Methodical Discussion</h3>
		<h4>06/29/14</h4>
		
		<p>
			In contrasting arrays and hashes and considering scenarios in which to use one or the other, it's helpful to first consider their public methods and look at meaningful overlap (or lack of overlap). Below I've pasted the methods available to only arrays and only hashes, and the methods available to both. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Hashes and arrays share 32 methods. Arrays have a total of 94 methods, meaning that 62 methods are unique to arrays (and are not available for hashes). Hashes have a total of 56 methods, so only 24 are unique to hashes and unavailable to arrays.
		</p>
		<p>
			Already this superficially shows us that arrays are a little more malleable - a larger number of methods generally means more diverse operations possible. However, we can further discuss what types of methods are common or unique, and consider their implications for how to best use each.
		</p>
		<p>
			Both can be created with ::new, and new elements can be appended to both using #[]=. With both arrays and hashes, we can test collection-level equality and whether one array/hash has the same elements, ordering, and size as another one. Methods like #assoc, #fetch, #include? are common to both collectiosn and can tell us whether certain elements are in the collection. Both have the #each method to loop through the collection and execute a block for every element.
		</p>
		<p>
			Arrays are unique in that the elements in the array are sort of all one type, whereas hashes' elements are key-value pairs. With this sort of collection in an explicit (index-based) order, certain mathematical functions make more sense. Arrays have unique functions like finding the intersection between two arrays, finding the difference between two arrays, finding combinations and permutations of elements, and extracting unique elements from an array. Since order is more important than for hashes, there are more methods to manipulate order (e.g. rotate and shuffle) and specify locations for inserting or removing elements (e.g. slice and insert). THe use of nested arrays is also common, so methods like #bsearch (finds an array within array with given condition) and #transpose are unique to arrays.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hashes have elements that are key-value pairs, and the methods unique to hashes are related to this. There are methods that test for the existence of specific keys or values (i.e. #has_key? or #has_value?), and methods like #default that check default value assignments if no value is explicitly given for a key. There are also methods unique to hashes that update a hash with new information - this includes #merge, which creates a new hash with elements from two other hashes, and in the case of same keys, overwriting with the new hash's values. Also in this category is #rehash, which updates the hash if key objects change.
		</p>
		<p>
			So what's the conclusion? This discussion of methods should hopefully help in deciding whether to use an array or hash for any specific purpose based on what needs to be done. If we're expecting to manipulate the order of elements and the elements are largely independent of each other aside from belonging to the same collection, an array is likely the better choice. If there are relationships among a collection of elements such as pairings or groupings of elements into named subsets, a hash may be more convenient and intuitive.
