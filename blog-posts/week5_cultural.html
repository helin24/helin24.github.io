		<h3>Pairing, Paring, Pearing</h3>
		<h4>07/06/14</h4>
		
		<p>
			Pairing:
		</p>
		<p>
			Generally I've found it helpful and enjoyable to pair, even if it's not something I explicitly look forward to. When programming alone, I am allowed to be unpresentable, grumpy, and distracted (not that this is my usual programming state) - which is comfortable even if it ultimately will make me less happy. When pairing, it's much easier to stay focused on the problem and make sure everything makes sense. This has been especially useful when reading through confusing code, because when reading alone I would be more likely to skim over and partially understand the sequence of events.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've found that thinking about logic can be hard to do in a pair because I'm not great at thinking while there's talking or pressure to talk, and often logic requires halting moments and repeated reviews of a line to understand what's going on - not ideally conversational. This may change once we start pairing in person, because part of the problem is that testing code remotely in a way that both people feel involved can be less convenient.
		</p>
		<p>
			It can be hard to know how decisive/assertive to be. I've noticed while rating feedback that more feedback is skewed towards "be more assertive," but this is difficult to do and definitely the riskier tact. Being non-assertive at worst can be annoying, while being too assertive at worst can be offensive. I think this may also change in person, as we'll be more able to pick up visual cues, and also as we become more comfortable with one another and understand how we learn best.
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			When I read my feedback, I was mostly worrying, "Ack I've been too harsh in my feedback and ratings! I'm going to come across as an uptight east coast person!" (one of my concerns coming from New York). I think in my previous job my managers and everyone else tended to be tough graders and I adopted the mentality that no one really should receive full scores for everything. For example, the phrase "I feel inspired and motivated by..." I may have interpreted too worshipfully - as in, "Always" would be reserved for someone like the pope.
 		</p>
 			Often when writing feedback, I have found it hard to write constructive things - generally I've enjoyed pairing with everyone and any critiques were as much a critique of myself as for the other person. 
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			Paring:
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			What do I think could be adjusted? I think the feedback could be improved by anonymizing further - as it stands, I can pretty much tell who gave me each piece of feedback because there are mentions of things like the language or other specificities that easily indicate the situation. To reduce this, we could have an additional step where two feedback items destined for one person are combined into one, reducing redundancy (if the same commendations/critiques are mentioned) and providing better anonymity. 
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			It would also make sense to blend the Always/Mostly/etc. ratings across all pairing partners. This would anonymize ratings and provide a useful summary of how focused/inspiring/comfortable we are - e.g. this way I could see that 50% of my partners thought I was sometimes helpful and 50% found me always helpful.
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			Pearing:
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			Pears pair well with various cheeses... if pared. I have no other thoughts on this.
